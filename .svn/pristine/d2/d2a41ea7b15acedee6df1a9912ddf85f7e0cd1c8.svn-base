				<h2>Background
				</h2>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span >The special
						program for Key BasicResearch of the Chinese Ministry of Science
						and Technology aimed at the basicresearch projects which are of
						great importance to the development of economy,social, science and
						technology in China. The project of National Basic datasurvey of
						Danxia landform is supported by this program, with duration
						fromJune, 2013 to May, 2018. As the principal scientist, Prof.
						Peng Hua from SunYat-sen University takes over this project. This
						project is a foundation forthe establishment of subject system of
						Danxia landform. It will build amanagement and service platform
						about the basic data of Danxia landform, and itwill develop into
						an information service and information sharing platform forthe
						applied research of Danxia landform and the internationalization
						of Danxialandform research. </span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>Presided by the
						Chinese Ministry ofScience and Technology, the opening ceremony
						and symposium of this project wereheld at Bayannur, Inner Mogolia,
						on August 17, 2013. After an in-depthdiscussion on the working
						plan and technical standard, consultant expertsagreed to start
						this project</span>
				</p>
				<h2>Brief introduction of this project
				</h2>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>Named by
						Chinese geoscientists, Danxialandform refers to a special type of
						red bed landform featured by steep cliffs,and it has been studied
						for more than 80 years in China. In order to providesupport for
						the application of China Danxia for World Heritage,
						twointernational symposiums on Danxia landform were held in May,
						2009 and October,2011, respectively. In July, 2009, IAG Danxia
						Geomorphology Working Group wasestablished at the 7<sup><span
							style="font-size: 2px;">th</span> </sup> IAG international conference.
						In thedeclaration of the first conference of Danxia Working Group
						in 2011, one of theobjectives was to promote global research on
						Danxia landform on the basis ofChinese research achievements. At
						the 34<sup><span style="font-size: 2px;">th</span> </sup> World
						Heritage Conventionin August, 2010, six serial sites of China
						Danxia were inscribed on the list ofWorld Heritage Sites. However,
						the resolution of World Heritage Committee(34COM 8B.1) also
						provided the following requirements: the contracting partyshould
						continue to support the scientific research on Danxia landform and
						theorganization of international conference; the contracting party
						should alsoprovide the main research achievements about China
						Danxia and actively promotethe international recognition of China
						Danxia. </span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>During recent
						years, significantprogress on China Danxia landform research has
						been made and it has arousedconcern from international colleagues.
						However, as the foundation of globalresearch on Danxia landform,
						there are still a lot of work need to be done,especially basic
						data collection and integration. Therefore, it is of
						greatsignificance to conduct the basic data survey of Danxia
						landform and theestablishment of database in the following
						aspects:</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(1) Providea firm foundation for the
						improvement of the subject system of Danxai landform.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(2) Providea data platform for the global
						comparison study on Danxia landform.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(3) Establishan information visualization
						system and real-time updated system about thebasic data of Danxia
						landform. This will be the foundation for the sciencedisplay and
						global promotion of Danxia landform.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(4) Providebasic information and science
						support for applied research in Danxia regions,such as the
						development and utilization of Danxia landform, science
						educationand tourism, ecological restoration, and disaster
						prevention.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(5) Showcasethe research achievements and
						provide a communication platform for globalresearch on Danxia
						landform. </span>
				</p>
				<h2>Projecttask
				</h2>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>In order to
						make sure that the basicdata of Danxia landform could meet the
						needs of future research, a series ofmethods, combined by the
						traditional survey and modern technology, such asfield
						investigation (combination of surface and key-point
						investigation,integration of the interpretation of remote sensing
						imagery and geological map,supplementary observation by
						instruments, etc.), lab test (analysis on physicaland chemical
						properties of rock samples, establishment of a standarddescription
						system of lithology), mathematical calculation (coding
						andprocessing of collected data, cluster analysis, and system
						analysis, etc), andcomputer technology (distributed methods based
						on cloud storage platform,artificial intelligence, data
						visualization, the management platform technologyof unstructured
						data), will be applied to complete the following work of
						datacollection and processing. </span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(1) Establisha
						classification system of Danxia landform, a technology standard
						and operationspecification for field survey.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(2) Conducta
						pre-survey in some typical Danxia areas to collect data and lab
						test, so asto modify and improve the technical standard.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span=>(3) Basedon the
						pre-survey, a comprehensive and normalized investigation will
						beconducted in more than 300 typical Danxia sites to collect data
						and make labtest on rock samples.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(4) Makea code
						system of every element data.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(5) Builda database
						of Danxia landform.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(6) Visualizethe
						space, morphology features and data relation of Danxia landform,
						form adisplay system of the basic data of Danxia landform.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(7) Establisha
						service platform with the functions of data management, access
						management,and real-time update. By providing a powerful
						capability of concurrency supportfor worldwide users, it will
						develop into an global service system of dataaccess, research and
						display of Danxia landform.</span>

						basic survey of other Danxia landform areas, and be used
						asreference for the compliment of technical documents of other
						landform types.Meanwhile, a dictionary, classification system, and
						index system of Danxialandform will also be completed.</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(4) Information sharing of Danxialandscape</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>By building
						links with some importantdomestic and overseas portal websites, in
						addition to be played as a window forscience education, this
						project can also be used as a window for landscapepromotion. It
						will be of great significance to increase the
						internationalpopularity and tourism development of Danxia
						landform.</span>

				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>(5) Global promotion of researchoutcome</span>
				</p>
				<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
					<span>During this
						project, for promotion ofDanxia landform and also the collection
						of advices, some national andinternational conference will be
						held. When this project was finished, theresearch outcome and the
